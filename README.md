# Predictive Maintenance System for IIoT Devices using Real-time Data Analytics and Anomaly Detection

## Project Description

This project is a Streamlit application designed to monitor and analyze real-time data from Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) devices, specifically focusing on generator data. The application uses an anomaly detection model to identify anomalies in the data and a finetuned GPT-3.5 Turbo model to interpret these anomalies and generate actionable recommendations.

## Features

- Real-time data generation and monitoring
- Anomaly detection using a custom-trained model
- Interpretation of anomalies using GPT-3.5 Turbo
- Visual representation of generator data
- Insight generation and display
- Email alerts for detected anomalies
